Lilo Scheduler – Project Prompt (Copy–Paste Ready)

Title: Lilo Scheduler – AI-Powered Personal Time & Habit Manager

Idea in one line:
Build a modern web app where users log in, manage their daily/weekly/yearly schedules, set smart alarms, and chat with an AI assistant called Lilo that helps them plan and organize everything automatically.

Core Flow:

Authentication First:

Landing → Login / Sign Up / Register page.

Only registered users can access the main dashboard.

Top-Right User Profile:

After login, show the user’s email / avatar icon on the top-right.

Clicking the email/icon opens a profile panel with:

Email ID

(Hashed) password change option

Basic personal info (name, college, time zone, etc.)

Right-Side Hamburger Menu (☰) – Schedules:

A 3-line menu icon on the right opens a side drawer with:

Daily schedule

Weekly schedule

Monthly schedule

Yearly / long-term schedule

Each schedule is stored in the database per user (so it remembers across logins).

Each entry should save:

Title of task

Date & time

Repeat pattern (one-time / daily / weekly / monthly / yearly)

Optional notes

Smart Calendar + Reminder System:

Calendar view with:

Year view (for long goals)

Month view

Week view

Day view

For each entry, the system:

Stores it in the database

Triggers reminders (like alarm/notification) at the scheduled time

Support custom alarms (sound + notification text).

To-Do List + Habit Tracking (Dashboard Center):

On the main dashboard, show:

Today’s To-Do list (tasks with checkboxes and times)

Upcoming tasks for the current week

User can:

Add tasks with time and date

Mark as done

Auto-create repeated tasks (e.g., “Wake up at 6:00 AM every day in April”)

Example:

User sets: “Wake up at 6:00 AM, every day in April”

System automatically creates 30/31 tasks + reminders for that month.

Lilo – AI Chatbot at Bottom Right:

Floating AI chat bubble in the bottom-right corner.

Name: Lilo.

Wake word: when user types “Lilo, …” or clicks Lilo, the assistant “wakes up”.

Lilo should:

Answer general questions (study, productivity, etc.)

Help the user create schedules from natural language:

“Lilo, schedule DBMS revision every Sunday at 8 PM this month”

“Lilo, remind me about project review on 15th March at 3 PM”

Suggest to-do lists based on queries like:

“I want to prepare for my exams in 10 days, create a plan.”

Read/write from the user’s stored schedules (so it can say:
“You have Math revision at 6 PM and Project work at 8 PM today.”)

Visual Design & UX:

Theme: Modern, vibrant, minimal, professional.

Use:

Gradient backgrounds (blues, purples, teals)

Smooth animations (on page load, menu open, button hover)

Clean typography (clear headings + soft body text)

The first impression should feel:

Premium, startup-grade, eye-catching

Not like a basic college project UI.

Data Structures & CRUD (for academic requirement):

Internally use data structures to manage tasks and schedules:

Queue / Priority Queue – to manage upcoming reminders by time.

Linked List or Array of Objects – for daily/weekly to-do items.

CRUD operations on tasks:

Create – Add schedule / task

Read – View today / week / month

Update – Edit timings, repeat pattern, notes

Delete – Remove tasks / reminders

You can highlight in documentation that:

“Lilo Scheduler uses queues/priority queues for managing upcoming alarms and schedules, fulfilling data structures (DS) project requirements.”

Tech Stack (flexible, but suggested):

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with modern UI framework or Tailwind if wanted)

Backend: Node.js/Express or Firebase Functions

Database: Firebase / Firestore / MongoDB (per-user schedules & tasks)

AI: Google Gemini / any LLM API wrapped behind a backend endpoint

Goal:
Build a fully working “Lilo Scheduler” prototype where students can log in, manage their time, and rely on an AI assistant to auto-plan, remind, and organize tasks in a visually attractive, professional interface that also demonstrates proper use of data structures and CRUD operations.
